# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

**ðŸ‘¤ Name:** Abhishek Kumar
**ðŸ“… First Contribution:** May 2024
**ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Git, Ethical AI Development

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**
I began my open-source journey with a focus on making my data science work **reproducible and ethically sound**. My initial hurdle wasn't coding, but rather ensuring I contributed valuable work and avoided low-effort commits. My first major Pull Request involved meticulously testing a feature, fixing a license file, and then submitting the patch, ensuring the code was non-plagiarized and adhered to the project's standards. This taught me that **integrity and rigorous self-review** are non-negotiable. I realized that respectful communication and providing clear, constructive reviews to other collaborators are as important as the code itself. Open source is a shared responsibility, built on trust and mutual respect for time.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**
Uphold the **integrity** of the community above all else: Read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide thoroughly, **test your changes rigorously**, and remember that an honest typo fix is infinitely more valuable than a frivolous, untested feature. **Quality over rush.** ðŸš€
